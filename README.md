# Module-4-HTML-Assignment
Coding Temple Software Engineering Assignment on Basic HTML Concepts

In this assignment, we were required to create a basic webpage including a navigation bar, a table, a form, and an image.

My page is for a fictional brand called "CoolShirts" that offers custom screen-printed merchandise such as t-shirts, hoodies, and caps. 

Here's how I did it:

1. I added a style attribute for a sans-serif font family in the "body" section for a clean, modern look
2. In my header section, I added an h1 heading welcoming users to the site, followed by a brief description of the website
3. I then included a navigation bar that can link users to the About section (where they can find the pricing table) and the Contact section (where they can find the contact form)
4. I labelled my About section with an ID of "about" and included an h2 heading + a brief description of what the company does
5. I then added a pricing table that showcased popular products along with their price per unit and minimum quantities
6. For bonus credit, I created a header row labelling the columns
7. I gave the table a border of "1" for a more organized look
8. I labelled my Contact section with an ID of "contact" and included an h2 heading + a paragraph encouraging users to fill out the contact form
9. I split my Contact Form into two Field Sets: Personal Information and Inquiry
10. For bonus credit, I added a "How did you hear about us?" radio button to the Inquiry Field Set
11. For stylistic purposes, I changed the font size on the "Submit" button to 150% to make it stand out
12. Finally, I added some placeholder images
13. For bonus credit, I rounded the corners of the second placeholder image using a border radius of 20 px
14. Additionally, I added a right margin of 50 px to the first image to add some white space between the images
15. Throughout the document, I used Semantic Layout to organize my page and help with accessibility and SEO.
